AirbnbViewController
====================

Airbnb 4.7's three-dimensional slide menu. Unfortunately, this menu is obsoleted in Airbnb 5.0. In order not to forget the legend menu, I developed it.

Inspired by https://github.com/TaPhuocHai/PHAirViewController.

Overview
## Description

Storyboard is not supported. You need to write code.

## Demo



## Install


Copy & paste the AirbnbViewController folder into your project.

And then, you need to have [project-name]-Bridging-Header.h because AirbnbViewController use Objective-c file.

[project-name]-Bridging-Header.h

```objc
#import "AirbnbHelper.h"
```
